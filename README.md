#Fast Facts in Swift.

Now open source!

There are some files that are app-specific and therefore not part of this repo. These include:

+ AppDelegate.swift (the analytics secret key is here)
+ The whole scraper module
+ The database
+ The HTML files

So this won't work out of the box, but hopefully the design helps someone somewhere.
